# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-in-Python

Overview :

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The program allows two players to take turns making moves on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

Features :

> Interactive Gameplay: Two players can take turns making moves on the console.
> Winning Conditions: The game checks for winning conditions after each move to determine if a player has won.
> Draw Detection: If no player wins, the game detects when the board is full, resulting in a draw.
> Error Handling: The program includes basic error handling to handle invalid inputs and moves.

Game Rules :

> The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
> Players take turns to mark an empty cell with their symbol (X or O).
> The first player to have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
> If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.
